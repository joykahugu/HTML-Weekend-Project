         My name is Joy Kahugu. I am currently a third year student in University pursuing a degree on Biotechnology. For the past three months
         and for two more months, I have been on a break from school. I decided to take this coding class in order to learn how to code and, 
         arrange data and algorithms. This is helpful in the biotechnology field. Outside of class, I enjoy reading fiction novels, hanging out 
         with my friends, dancing, and listening to Music. This is just a small bit about myself. For more information, you can head to the
         sections listed below.
